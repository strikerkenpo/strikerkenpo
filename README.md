Hello, 
I graduated last year with degree in programming. Looking to get into the field. I currently work as a Network Admin. Went back to school to learn more about the coding side. Right know I am versed in Python, Java, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and C#.
My favorite language is C# so I have focused more on that. 

I have been teaching myself React and Rest APIs lately to gain more knowledge about Full stack development. Hoping to post some projects I have been working on soon.
